# üõí Buy Current Price Mode - Instant Market Entry

## üéØ Feature Overview
The **Buy Current Price Mode** allows you to instantly enter the market at the current price when starting the bot, rather than waiting for a price drop. This is perfect for trending markets or when you want immediate position establishment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### Command Line:
```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
npm run start:enhanced:buycurrentprice

# Direct node command
node enhanced-bot.js --buy-current-price
```

### Package.json Script:
```json
"start:enhanced:buycurrentprice": "node enhanced-bot.js --buy-current-price"
```

## üîÑ Execution Flow

### 1. Bot Startup
- Bot initializes with `buyCurrentPriceMode = true`
- Connects to OKX API
- Fetches current market data and balances

### 2. Position Check
- Checks if you have any existing position in the target coin (ETH)
- If position exists: Skips market buy, continues normal trading
- If no position: Proceeds to market buy

### 3. Market Buy Execution
- Calculates buy amount: Uses `MAX_USDT_TO_USE` from .env (safety limit)
- Places market buy order at current price
- Example: $30 USDT at $3,200 = 0.009375 ETH

### 4. Target Setting
- Sets fixed sell target based on average cost + threshold
- Example: $3,200 √ó 1.004 = $3,212.80 sell target
- Updates position tracker with new holding

### 5. Normal Trading
- Switches to regular trading mode
- Monitors for sell opportunities at fixed target
- After sell, calculates new buy target using hybrid strategy

## üí∞ Configuration

### Required Settings (.env):
```properties
TRADING_SYMBOL=ETH-USDT           # Target trading pair
MAX_USDT_TO_USE=30                # Budget for market buy
MIN_ORDER_SIZE=8                  # Minimum order validation
PRICE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD=0.004      # 0.4% threshold for targets
ENABLE_FIXED_TARGETS=true         # Enable fixed target system
```

### Safety Features:
- ‚úÖ Only executes if no existing position
- ‚úÖ Respects MAX_USDT_TO_USE limit
- ‚úÖ Validates minimum order size
- ‚úÖ Only executes once per bot session
- ‚úÖ Uses intelligent order placement
